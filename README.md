# Vending Machine Using python and RaspberryPI

This project aims to create a milk vending machine using Raspberry Pi as the server, which interacts with a mobile application to receive input and dispense milk accordingly. The Raspberry Pi serves as the central control unit, managing the vending process based on user requests received through the mobile app.
